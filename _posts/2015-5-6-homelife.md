So I was reading [this article about Randi Zuckerberg](http://thelastpsychiatrist.com/2014/01/randi_zuckerberg.html) as one does, and came across this moniest of quotes.

> Here's your #OWS update: work doesn't bleed over into home because capitalism is evil, work bleeds over to home because we have no idea what else to do at home, and thank God we can blame it on work.

Is it because most knowledge workers run their households from work? I can at least affirm that I'm happiest at home. The sheer notion of being this tremendously unhappy at home is the strangest thing to me.
