As much as I enjoy the rich texture of the English language and all of it's frivolities, I found [this article on Quartz](http://qz.com/396076/tretar-tsundoku-jugaad-and-other-useful-but-untranslatable-words-from-around-the-world/) that caused a pang of regret. Here's my two favorites:

> Tsundoku (Japanese): Leaving a book unread after buying it, typically piled up together with other unread books. 

> Cotisuelto (Caribbean Spanish): A man who insists on wearing his shirt tails untucked.

Imagine how much time you'd save having to explain my lifestyle to someone with those.
