I made some notes for the couple of keynotes I attended. Afterwards, I went through and spruced them up lightly. And then when I finsihed, I just kept the good notes that I took at the top of the ticket.

### Gene Kim

Mr. Kim went through many of the topics that his book Accelerate covered. Accelerate can be considered a "State of Devops" report that's been to the gym and really bulked up on some statistics and more organizational and cultural material.

- kubernetes sidecars for crosscuts
- aspect oriented programming
- importing expertise
- locality in our code
- composability
- bad - integrated test environment
- authority should belong to teams

Stanley McChrystal's Team of Teams got a shoutout.
-  [The Operators by the late Michael Hastings](https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Operators.html?id=xD8dDgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&source=kp_read_button#v=onepage&q&f=false) may be one of the best GWOT books every published.

Practices that enable "focus, flow, and joy"
- Immutablity is a thing that is nice about functional programming.
- Infrastructure immutability
- Git version control history is also immutable, we like that.
- What else is stateful? bash, yaml, updating dependencies

Platforms
- The job of platforms is to enable developers to solve business problems.
- Platforms enable developers to self-service with immediacy and fast feedback

Measuring success
- What is your lead time for changes?
- Usually read as "how long does committed code take to get to where the customer can realize the value"
- How long does it take to get a developer to realize a mistake in his code?
- Trunk based development
- improvement of daily work is more important the the daily work itself.
- learning organizations internalize ^^
- create as much feedback as possible

Daily workarounds are disruptive
- technical debt is insidious
- a book says 20% of cycles for tech debt reduction
- enabling greatness
- ideally, 3-5% of developers dedicated to improving developer productity.
- google puts the BEST devs off of features and into improving dev productivity
- playing the "forever" game

Organizational and Cultural Features
- psychological safety is predictive of performance
- strongest signal for performance in the devops survey study
- google made the same findings in "project aristotle, oxygen, re:work"

Enabling Great practices
- customer focus
- Functional silo managers priorotize silo goals over business goals
- if it doesn't create competetive advantage we should get it out of our business and outsource it
