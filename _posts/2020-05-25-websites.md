<p style="font-size:1.4em">As I've been spending more time online than ever, I'm beginning to feel like websites are blurring together. Websites like Medium and Reddit seem to be oriented around one "kind" of content and don't really employ a <em>bespoke</em> content-aware approach to how it's presented. Browsers are more powerful than ever, and yet content is being drawn in more and more generic boxes. Towards that end, I went through my neverending Instapaper backlog (another way to make content appear extremely samey is to read it through an app like Instapaper, I suppose) looking for websites that are design first.</p>
