summary: I spent way to much time looking at backpacks to commute with. Here's what I thought about the pack of packs.

**picture of that ** 

So, I went and ordered myself a c√¥te&ciel Isar today (Large, Black Eco-Yarn), and I figured since I dumped way too much time poking around looking at alternatives, I may as well the world my surface-impression runoff of the bags that didn't get the nod.

I started by making a list in a [Things](https://culturedcode.com/things/) project to keep track of what I looked at and to try and eliminate each contender as quickly as possible.

So, what do I carry every day? Here's the breakdown as I found it this evening:

* A contemporary Dell Lattitude for work
* A 13" MacBook Air in a [Tom Bihn Cache](https://www.tombihn.com/products/cache?variant=23012415687) laptop sleeve
* A Dr. Ion Bag-in-a-bag 

I was/am using a Timbuk2 Especial Raider backpack which has it's benefits:

1. Machine washable
2. Super light
3. Affordable at the $50 I found it at. [^fn1]


But what I've found is that I need smaller water bottles to fit without stressing the bag around.

### Footnotes.

[^fn1]: Oddly enough, if you're ever after to buy Timbuk2 gear, I can highly recommend Newegg as the retailer of choice. They've been consistently price competitive in my experience.
