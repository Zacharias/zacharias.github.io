Linked lists are periodic blog posts that are neat little things I saw on the internet. You know, web logging.

### Listen to this

> Future Funk is a music genre that emerged from the Vaporwave genre in the summer of 2012. It is characterized with the heavy use of samples, primarily of 70's and 80's funk and disco.

There is a [terrific subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/futurefunk/) around the genre which seems almost like it's designed to make you think the future is going to be a lot more rad than contemporary US politics would lead you to believe. 


### Nerd stuff

Here is a nice way to [learn yourself what a .map file is](https://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/developertools/sourcemaps/)

[My favorite agile-ism](http://retrospectivewiki.org/index.php?title=The_Prime_Directive)

I've been learning a lot chasing down the next-scariest place to manage in my software shop's stack. That has lead me towards learning about the principles of Database Lifecycle Management. Being able to deploy an application well means being able to deploy it's database well, too.

Speaking of scary things [Panic recently had a worst-case scenario](https://panic.com/blog/stolen-source-code/) happen where an external party got to exfiltrate a bunch of their source code. How it could be prevented, handled, and de-risked going forward is really useful to know.

### Miscellanea

a [great explainer](https://www.philadelinquency.com/2017/06/13/not-sure-local-news-screwing-no-panhandling-policy/) as to why giving money on the el is likely not the best idea.

An simple way to tamp down on [your jerk index](https://qz.com/1027802/there-are-two-kinds-of-popularity-and-we-are-choosing-the-wrong-one/?mc_cid=f52927c05d&mc_eid=d5153d611f_).

> this generation said, ‘We don’t care about owning a car.’ Cars used to be what people aspired to own. Now it’s the smartphone. -- Mark Norman, the Zipcar’s president and chief operating officer

As much as the world likely does not want for yet another [millenials are killing x thinkpiece](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2012/09/the-cheapest-generation/309060/), I am perplexed by the notion that there's a dichotomy between owning a phone/pocket computer genie and cars, things that are not telephones, genies, or very magic. I suspect when this article says millenia would rather have a $1000/year smartphone and access, _instead of_ a $20,000+ Subaru when most folks could afford both means to me that they're asking the wrong question. There's no bus for the internet (or Uber for the smartphoneless). And who is still *aspiring* to a product that [over three quarters of adults already own](http://www.pewinternet.org/fact-sheet/mobile/)?

I'd really love to find a way to work [Whitney Narrow](https://www.typography.com/fonts/whitney-narrow/styles/?utm_source=Email&utm_medium=Email&utm_content=WhitneyNarrow&) into my next web project.
