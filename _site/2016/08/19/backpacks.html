    	<p>I went and ordered myself a Côte&amp;Ciel Isar today after what turned out to be a fairly sweeping multi-week trip through the internet-backpack-industrial complex and I figured since I dumped way too much time poking around looking at alternatives, I may as well inflict upon the world my surface-impression runoff of the bags that didn’t get the nod. </p>

<p>And hey, it’s back to school time anyways.</p>

<p>I started by making a list in a <a href="https://culturedcode.com/things/">Things</a> project to keep track of what I looked at and to try and eliminate each contender as quickly as possible. After all, I supposedly have important, high-value things to do.</p>

<p>So, what do I carry every day? Here’s the breakdown as I found it this evening:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A contemporary Dell Latitude for work</li>
  <li>13” MacBook Air in a <a href="https://www.tombihn.com/products/cache?variant=23012415687">Tom Bihn Cache</a> laptop sleeve <sup id="fnref:fn1"><a href="#fn:fn1" class="footnote">1</a></sup></li>
  <li>Dr. Ion Bag-in-a-bag </li>
  <li>Some paperback.</li>
  <li>Portable games console, light snack, the usual commuting stuff.</li>
</ul>

<p>I was/am using a Timbuk2 Especial Raider backpack which has it’s benefits:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Machine washable</li>
  <li>Super light</li>
  <li>Affordable at the $50 I found it at. <sup id="fnref:fn2"><a href="#fn:fn2" class="footnote">2</a></sup></li>
  <li>Water bottle pockets</li>
</ol>

<p>But what I’ve found is that I need smaller water bottles to fit without stressing the bag around. The 16L overall size is just on the right size of being able to fit all my stuff. If I pack a lunch, think I need to bring a jacket just in case, or do some light procuring on the way from home, I’m stuck carrying another bag. This is getting kind of old. </p>

<p>It’d be great if I can find a bag that’s just a little nicer than the one I’m working with. This is what I thought in mid-April when I spent an afternoon looking around.	</p>

				<p>Some brands get a pass on this (like an Osprey or Incase, where you know what you're getting), but a fashion brand doesn't get the benefit of the doubt.</p>

				<h4>What looked good?</h4>
				<p>This guy has some of the best reviews of anything, let alone backpacks. I own a smaller Osprey and it works great!</p>
				
				<h4>What knocked it out of the running</h4>
				<p>Unlike the others, I went to a store and tried this backpack out. While of high quality overall, I felt like this was too light, too insubstantial and for the usage of moving around computers and nerd in a city, it was too good at the wrong things.</p>
				<p>I can easily recommend this as a dayhiking pack, without a reservation. Osprey files it under "Technical Packs" for a reason, I suppose.</p>

				<p>It's a backpack! It's a briefcase! It's a messenger bag! It has an attractive combination of leather and nylon and just enough space to git my stuff without any extra hassle.</p>
				
				<h4>What knocked it out of the running</h4>
				<p>My current bag is just the right size for what I *usually* haul around, without any real affordances if I manage to truck around just a little more stuff, I get to carry around another bag from the grocer or wherever. No water bottle pockets, which I use like half of the time.</p>

				<h4>What knocked it out of the running</h4>
				<p>Without seeing it in real life, I had to rely on the internet to gather an opinion on this bag. <a href="http://www.carryology.com/bags/road-tests-topo-designs-rover-pack/">The first Carryology review</a> practically had me salivating. Then, <a href="http://www.carryology.com/reviews-2/road-test/topo-designs-x-uncrate-rover-pack-video-review/">this video review on Carryology</a> did bother me in regards to the bag's ability to not "keep itself together" and the lack of internal organization was a concern for me. Also, the drawstring aperture for the entire main section of the bag was a pretty big turnoff.</p>

				<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPwSmPLlPJw">This guy had me looking around for my car keys</a> to run out to the mall and buy one. It's practically waterproof! Stands up on it's own, I've had good bags by this brand in the past. Sufficient internal organization.</p>
				
				<h4>What knocked it out of the running</h4>
				<p>I found some scale images that put this bags proportions in check for me, it's entirely too big for an everydayer. The "depth" dimension seems pretty much take it or leave it, unlike the Topo Rover. Everything I put in the front of the bag is essentially out in the breeze. I'd put it on a list of weekenders, depending on how one packs.</p>

				<h4>What knocked it out of the running</h4>
				<p>Literally every video review of this bag on the internet was not in English. Apparently North American outdoor wear brands are doing great in South Korea (Globalization!) and some enthusiasts broke it down for me. This bag isn't for moving multiple laptops, let alone one. Considering the price and layout, I was pretty sure it wasn't appropriate for my use case.</p>

				<p>Clean lines! Expandable interior storage! Many interesting colorways. I like the idea of being in a mutual appreciation society with South Korea in regards to each other's outdoor/bag brands.</p>
				<h4>What knocked it out of the running</h4>
				<p>Expensive! To "complete the purchase" you have to buy about another $50 of accessories. It's really hard to buy. The only place that sells the large size is Helinox site, which wasn't super user-friendly. Shipping was more than $20. Listen, I understand that is likely how much shipping actually costs, but I'm too used to not having to spend that much. Oh hey no water bottle pockets. I think the Invisible Backpack is the only one I've seen that split the clean line/useful exterior storage line.</p>

				<p>If it works half as good as it looks it does, it'd be a great value.</p>
				<h4>What knocked it out of the running</h4>
				<p>It's godawful expensive. How big it the market for over $300 backpacks? Have I wasted too much time on Uncrate and can't tell anymore? On a somewhat more serious note, there's a lot of spinning rims on this backpack, to the point where I'd almost feel bad if I didn't use the hell out of it.</p>
