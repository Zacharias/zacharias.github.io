Between [what's been announced]() and what's on the horizon for support, I'm excited to try out some of the great first party integrations between IOT devices and Apple's Homekit. Homekit has been a sleeper product from Apple for a while now, and there's never been a better time to make your home smarter given that we've all been stuck in them since March. Of course, there's competing platforms across the tech giants, and even within the giants themselves (Nest v. Google Home).

I've been playing around with [Homebridge]() which is a very cool open-source implementation of Apple's Homekit protocol, that allows an enterprising user to "bridge" devices that are within another platform's walled garden into Homekit's patch.

There's a [couple of commercial bridges](https://www.apple.com/shop/accessories/all-accessories/homekit?fh=482b%2B49fd) out there, to be used to connect otherwise propriety devices using commodity IOT protocols to "speak" Homekit either in addition to or instead of against a vendor-specific API. Given the fragmentation of competing protocols in IOT-land (this deserves a whole writeup, it's worse than it looks!), this sort of software goes from "cool" to necessary. 

If you can define things like temperature sensors and the like as code, it should be possible to define a camera in code and access it like a physical Homekit accessory.

And if I'm going to make a TV channel for _my_ house, I may as use the TV series [House MD](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0412142/) - I do own a couple of seasons' worth via thrifted DVDs. The good news is that you don't have to have the foresight to pull off this pun, most video files you can play in VLC will work (more on that later).

## Step 1: Install Homebridge on your computer

So, without much more fanfare, let's get into the steps. I'm using a Thinkpad x220, a pretty old and wonderful laptop as my "project computer" for this. It's running POP!OS, a pretty-much-Ubuntu-but-with-some-nice-affordances so I followed along [with these instructions](https://github.com/homebridge/homebridge/wiki/Install-Homebridge-on-Debian-or-Ubuntu-Linux) to get Homebridge installed. 

If you want your Homebridge instance to be durable over reboots and whatnot, I'd suggest installing it as a service using the instructions above. 

I've also went through the exercise installing this on Windows (somewhat) in WSL2 via Ubuntu 20.x and had similar results. The real job here is to getting a contemporary version of node installed on your system, so far I've never had to dive into Homebridge's source code to fiddle with any switches.

When that's all said and done, you should see something like this by visiting the `https://localhost:8581` url and logging in with `admin/admin` as your credentials:

## Step 2: RTSP (and Friends) Installation

This is where things went poorly for me on my first pass. 

I spent a lot of time convinced that there'd be a magic trick where I could perform multiple feats of inputs/outputs and stream arbitrary video content by using the right magic spells in VLC (there likely is, but I can't prove it). Based on the fact that I _did_ have good luck using the `ffmpeg-camera` plugin, connecting to an RTSP stream from an IP camera in my house, I drew up this divide-and-conquer strategy:

- Get a stream of my file setup to a local RTSP stream
- Re-stream that as a webcam in Homebridge

The advantage of this is that I could independently verify the RTSP stream works using VLC, and understand if a problem was caused by how the _stream_ worked verus how the _camera config in Homebridge_ worked. This allows us to solve two small-ish problems instead of having a big, hulking one.

You know you're working with a sharp knife when you reach for `ffmpeg` but that's exactly what we're doing. Now that I've been using it for a couple of kinds of files, I actually appreciate the "desired state" nature of `ffmpeg`, where you give it a perferred output and it does the math for you to get it translated, by using libraries that work for the particular computer you're using.


## Step 3: Adding the ffmpeg-camera plugin to Homebridge

This one's pretty straightforward. Using the "plugins" tab in your homebridge UI, add the `homebridge-camera-ffmpeg` plugin. This plugin allows you to use a huge variety of inputs

## Step 4: Camera Config in Homebridge

Thankfully, this is also a pretty straightforward process, since we're serving up a stream that's local to the same computer that'll be serving up the camera stream itself, anybody who is able to reach the Homebridge instance _should_ be able to recieve the stream. 


Potential Gremlin:
If your home network configuration is different than mine, you could have problems here.


## Lessons Learned

A very durable strategy for me, both professionally and on more hobbyist/educational persuits has been utilizing decomposition and other divide-and-conquer strategies to make a big cool thing out of little boring parts.

RTSP and other TCP-based streaming protocols have gone through massive changes since I was playing around with Winamp TV streams in 2004. I'm sure that's a combination of all of the commerical products, massive compute and bandwidth improvements in the intervening years, and the entire college degree I got in this business since then.

## Step 999: Production Readiness

Your one-person TV station is working and is a lovely thing that lives on your network in your home. It's far from perfect, and I have a list of `#TODO`s along the way for a second (third, for me, second was writing this up), that could be taken on as homework for the truly committed to this idea:

- Securing your Homebridge instance (admin/admin isn't the best credentials for a long-living install)
- Mediating remote access via Homepod or AppleTV
- Tweaking network config from your computer
